# Badger - Docker Container Management for Tests

### Overview

Badger is a tool designed for managing Docker containers. The project is currently under development, and the goal is to publish it on npm, allowing users to incorporate container management functionalities directly into their applications.

### Current Status

Badger is in active development. Users can currently test the application using the CLI. The final version will be published on npm, where users will be able to install it and use it programmatically in their projects.

## Testing Badger CLI

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system. This project uses Bun for managing dependencies and running scripts.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julianofirme/badger
cd badger
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

```bash
bun install
```

### Run the CLI

You can test the CLI commands using the following examples:

Create a Container

```bash
bun index.ts create postgres --port 5432 --env POSTGRES_USER=test --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test --env POSTGRES_DB=mydb
```

Stop a Container

```bash
bun index.ts stop <containerId>
```

Remove a Container

```bash
bun index.ts remove <containerId>
```

## Usage in Code (Future)

Once Badger is published, you will be able to use its functions in your codebase. Hereâ€™s an example of how to integrate Badger into your application:

```javascript
import {
  createContainer,
  stopContainer,
  removeContainer,
} from "badger";

async function manageContainers() {
  try {
    const container = await createContainer({
      container: "postgres",
      customEnvs: { POSTGRES_USER: "test", POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "test", POSTGRES_DB: "mydb" },
      port: "5432"
    });
    console.log(`Container started with ID: ${container.id}`);

    await stopContainer(container.id);
    console.log(`Container ${container.id} stopped.`);

    await removeContainer(container.id);
    console.log(`Container ${container.id} removed.`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error managing containers:", error);
  }
}

manageContainers();
```
